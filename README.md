# 🖥️ Discord System Monitor Bot

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)

A lightweight Discord bot designed to monitor system stats from a Raspberry Pi 5 (or any Linux-based machine). The bot periodically sends a live system status update to a selected Discord channel, including CPU load, memory usage, temperature, disk usage, and uptime.

## ✨ Features

- Live system stats updated in real time
- Details include:
  - 🧠 RAM usage
  - 🔥 CPU temperature
  - ⚙️ CPU usage
  - 💾 Disk space used
  - ⏱️ System uptime
  - `/htop` command to display an interactive process list directly in Discord (like the Linux `htop`)

## 💻 `/htop` Command

Use the `/htop` command to view a live list of the most resource-intensive processes on your machine.

- Shows unique processes sorted by CPU usage
- Displays:
  - 🔹 PID
  - 🖥️ CPU usage
  - 📊 Memory usage
- Includes interactive buttons to navigate between pages
- Output is styled to be Discord-friendly and readable

## 🛡️ Permission Restriction for `/htop` Command

The `/htop` command is restricted to a specific Discord user ID for security reasons. Only the designated user can run this command to view system processes.

The command code is located at [`src/commands/htop.js`](./src/commands/htop.js).

To customize which user can execute the command, update the `ALLOWED_USER_ID` constant in the command's code:

```js
const ALLOWED_USER_ID = "123456789012345678"; // REPLACE WITH YOUR USER ID
```

## 📦 Requirements

- Node.js 18 or higher
- A Discord bot token
- A Raspberry Pi 5 (or any Linux system with `/proc` access)
