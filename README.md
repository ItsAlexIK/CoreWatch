## üõ°Ô∏è Permission Restriction for `/htop` Command

The `/htop` command is restricted to a specific Discord user ID for security reasons. Only the designated user can run this command to view system processes.

The command code is located at [`src/commands/htop.js`](./src/commands/htop.js).

To customize which user can execute the command, update the `ALLOWED_USER_ID` constant in the command's code:

```js
const ALLOWED_USER_ID = "123456789012345678"; // REPLACE WITH YOUR USER ID
```

## üì¶ Requirements

- Node.js 18 or higher
- A Discord bot token
- A Raspberry Pi 5 (or any Linux system with `/proc` access)
